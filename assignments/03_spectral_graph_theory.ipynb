It mainly misses the exploratory data analysis part (though there is some in sections 5.1 and 5.2). As such, our plan for this assignement encompasses data collection and exploitation, and goes as follows:\n",
    "1. Data collection: use a web API to collect the musical genre of 2000 songs.\n",
    "2. Feature extraction: compute features from audio tracks.\n",
    "3. Graph construction: construct a nearest-neighbor graph from the features.\n",
    "4. Eigendecomposition: factorization of the graph Laplacian (c.f. spectral graph theory).\n",
    "5. Visualization & Clustering: using the graph and eigenvectors to visualize the dataset and to cluster the tracks.\n",
    "6. Conclusion: a reflexion about what we did (though realisations are scattered all along).\n",

The exploitation of the data showed us that a machine can discern musical genres by looking at pairwise distances between spectral features extracted from audio recordings."
