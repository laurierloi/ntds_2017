    "**1) find_connections function -> 20 points **\n",
    "\n",
    "Common mistakes included:\n",
    "* not using the Cursor object to iterate through pages\n",
    "* not accounting for protected users (if this was added in the network collection, points were removed only partially)\n",
    "\n",
    "** 2) collection of the Twitter network -> 30 points **\n",
    "\n",
    "Common mistakes included:\n",
    "* not handling protected users \n",
    "* not gathering different nodes in the first_nodes and the second_nodes list (only partial points extracted if the removal of duplicates was done efficiently in the next step)\n",
    "* adding protected users in the collected network and trying to recover their connections (not the best solution)\n",
    "    \n",

    "* Not removing at all existing duplicates\n",
    "* Removing only duplicates from first_nodes and second_nodes but not removing the duplicates of the nodes that were present in both of these lists\n",

    "**4) finding all of the inner connections between the collected nodes -> 20 points**\n",
    "\n",
    "Common mistakes included:\n",

    "* Only finding the inner connections between second nodes (remember that inner connections can exist also between two first nodes for instance)\n",
